# Day 1 – Linux Fundamentals (Basics)

## Overview
Today I learned the basic concepts of Linux and practiced essential commands that are commonly used in cybersecurity and system administration.

Linux is widely used in cybersecurity because it is open-source, flexible, secure, and provides powerful command-line tools.

## Basic Linux Commands Learned

### System & User Commands
- `whoami` – Displays the current logged-in user.
- `pwd` – Shows the present working directory.

---

### File & Directory Management
- `ls` – Lists files and directories.
- `cd` – Changes the current directory.
- `mkdir` – Creates a new directory.
- `touch` – Creates an empty file.
- `rm` – Deletes files or directories.

---

### File Content & Search
- `echo` – Prints text to the terminal or writes text into a file.
- `find` – Searches for files and directories in the filesystem.
- `grep` – Searches for specific text patterns inside files.

---

### Permissions
- `chmod` – Changes file permissions to control read, write, and execute access.

---

## Shell Operators Learned

- `&` – Runs a command in the background.
- `&&` – Executes the next command only if the previous one is successful.
- `<` – Redirects input from a file.
- `<<` – Used for multi-line input (here-document).

---

## Practical Usage in Cybersecurity
- Linux commands help in navigating systems efficiently.
- Searching logs and files using `grep` and `find` is essential in security analysis.
- Permission management (`chmod`) is important to prevent unauthorized access.
- Shell operators are useful for automation and chaining commands.

## What I Practiced
- Navigating directories
- Creating and deleting files
- Searching files and text
- Using shell operators in the terminal

## Key Takeaway
Understanding Linux fundamentals is essential for cybersecurity as most security tools and servers run on Linux.
